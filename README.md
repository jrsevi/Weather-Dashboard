# Weather-Dashboard


## Description

This is a weather application I made using HTML, CSS, and Java Script. The application gets weather information from the OpenWeatherAPI.

## installation

n/a

## Usage

To use the weather app, type a US city's name into the search bar in the header and press the search button. After that the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed will be displayed as well as an icon displaying the current weather condition. 

At the bottom of the page a 5 day forecast will be displayed for the selected city, displaying the same information as above.

After a search is made the city will be recorded in the page's header, where the user is free to click on their recent search and be brought back to that city's weather information.
